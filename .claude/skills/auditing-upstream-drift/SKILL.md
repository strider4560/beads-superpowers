# Auditing Upstream Drift

> **Maintainer-only skill for the [beads-superpowers](https://github.com/strider4560/beads-superpowers) repository — not distributed.**
> Before doing anything else: if the current repo is not beads-superpowers (no `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` whose `name` is `beads-superpowers`), say so and STOP — this skill audits that repo against its upstreams and is useless anywhere else.

This is the quality gate for the beads-superpowers plugin. It verifies everything — upstream staleness, test pass rates, documentation accuracy, plugin manifest validity, hook functionality, content integrity, and beads integration completeness.

**Iron Law:** NO PLUGIN RELEASE WITHOUT A FULL AUDIT FIRST. Audit findings with security or material-risk impact are never downgraded to make a release, and phases are never skipped for a date (Production-Grade Doctrine).

## When to Use

- Before any plugin version bump or release
- Monthly (or after upstream releases of superpowers or beads)
- When a user reports a skill behaves differently than expected
- When beads adds new CLI features that skills should leverage
- After any bulk refactoring of skills or tests
- After merging upstream changes

## Upstream Sources

| Source | Repository | Our Baseline | What We Track |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Superpowers** | [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | v6.2.0 | Skills content, new skills, hook structure, plugin manifest |
| **Beads** | [gastownhall/beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) | v1.1.2 | CLI commands, new features, bd prime format, deprecations |
| **mex** | [mex-memory/mex](https://github.com/mex-memory/mex) (`mex-agent` on npm) | 0.7.1 (verified live 2026-08-19) | CLI commands, `.mex/` layout, router format, exit-code semantics |

## Known Deliberate Divergences

These shared skills intentionally differ from upstream superpowers. When Phase 5 (Check 5.3) flags them as CHANGED, that is expected — do **not** revert them toward upstream. Adopt only upstream changes that don't reverse these decisions.

| Area / Skill | We do | Upstream does | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **All shared skills** | `bd` task tracking — beads is the ledger | `TodoWrite` / markdown TODOs | The fork's reason for existence: cross-session persistence |
| **using-git-worktrees, finishing-a-development-branch** | `bd worktree` Iron Law; reject native-tool-first selection | native worktree tool first → `.worktrees/` → raw `git worktree` | native-first bypasses beads-DB sharing across worktrees (ADR-0014; audit finding #6) |
| **finishing-a-development-branch** | Land the Plane (`bd close` → `bd dolt push` → `git push`) | no session-close ritual | core to the beads workflow |
| **subagent-driven-development** | beads is the durable ledger; Parallel Batch Mode kept; `bd merge-slot` optional | markdown progress ledger | beads survives compaction; single orchestrator already serializes merges (ADR-0013, ADR-0012) |
| **using-superpowers** | Claude Code tool names + per-CLI `references/` maps (trimmed to harness-specific content, superset of upstream's 3-file set) | fully vendor-neutral tool vocabulary | we ship multi-CLI adapters, not one neutral vocabulary (ADR-0006) |
| **Beads integration** | CLI-only: call `bd` directly in skills + one SessionStart hook composing beads context (curated memories + a `bd prime` pointer); no beads Claude plugin or beads-mcp server | Claude plugin + MCP server | Lowest overhead; full `bd` command coverage; matches beads' own "CLI + hooks when shell is available" guidance (ADR-0017) |
| **brainstorming, writing-plans** | stress-test (a fork-only skill) is offered at the approval gate via a 3-option "Approved + stress-test" gate folded into the upstream Approved/Needs-changes review gate | 2-option review gate; no stress-test (stress-test does not exist upstream) | stress-test is one of our 7 fork-unique skills; offering it at every spec/plan gate is intended fork behavior (ADR-0020) |
| **using-superpowers + judgment/gate skills (doctrine class)** | fork-only Production-Grade Doctrine: canonical `## Production-Grade Doctrine` block in `using-superpowers` PLUS self-contained woven doctrine-floor lines (incl. the security floor) in judgment/gate skills | no such doctrine (obra/superpowers has none) | intended fork behavior (ADR-0023/0036/0040); on re-sync PRESERVE every woven doctrine-floor line; mark SKIP, not Conflict |
| **using-superpowers + question-gate skills (ask-user class)** | fork-only ask-user convention: `## Asking the User` block in `using-superpowers`, self-contained consent lines at the 3 destructive gates (finishing-a-development-branch, document-release, using-git-worktrees), adapt parentheticals on the 6 JSON gate lead-ins, quirk rows in `references/{opencode,codex,pi}-tools.md` | upstream uses bare generic phrasing with no convention block (zero in-skill tool refs) | intended fork behavior (ADR-0041); on re-sync PRESERVE all four elements; mark SKIP, not Conflict |
| **All shared skills (namespace)** | cross-skill references use `beads-superpowers:<skill>` | bare `superpowers:<skill>` | upstream's bare namespace points at the upstream plugin; in our fork it must carry our plugin name or it resolves to the wrong plugin (intended; mark SKIP, not Conflict) |
| **brainstorming** | brainstorm session dir + auth-token files live under `.internal/brainstorm/` (self-ignored) | upstream uses `.superpowers/brainstorm/` | one canonical `.internal/` scratch root (spec 2026-06-30); `server.cjs` unchanged — do not revert the path on re-sync |
| **Codex SessionStart hook** | keep it — still fires `using-superpowers` bootstrap + composed beads context | v6.1.0 removed theirs ("Codex reliably triggers skills on its own, and the bootstrap hook made the UX worse rather than better") | ours also carries composed beads context injection (curated memories + a `bd prime` pointer), not just the skill bootstrap upstream deemed redundant (ADR-0039, 2026-07-02) |
| **SessionStart matcher** | `startup|resume|clear|compact` | `startup|clear|compact` | added in bd-3ogl.2 to cover session resumption |
| **writing-skills** | not shipped — removed 2026-07-10 (e4w8) | ships the writing-skills meta-skill | upstream maintenance weight; Check 5.2 will list it as upstream-new — mark SKIP |
| **.pi/extensions/superpowers.ts** | appends composed beads context (`bd prime` exec) + `beads-superpowers:` bootstrap marker | bootstrap-only extension | beads context is the fork's reason to exist |
| **test-driven-development** `spec-backed` floor | Fork-only design-artifact precondition before code | no design-artifact precondition | Do NOT file as "revert toward upstream" — it is the default-install design gate, pinned in `KERNEL_MAP` |
| **.codex-plugin/marketplace.json** | ships it (version-synced mirror of .claude-plugin's) | no such file | kept deliberately for Codex marketplace flows |
| **OpenCode plugin** | upstream's `.opencode/plugins/` file as base + minimal beads graft (composer bootstrap, compaction re-injection, pointer fallback) | `superpowers.js` static-bootstrap transform | beads context is the fork's core; layout/mechanism otherwise upstream-verbatim |
| **subagent-driven-development** (fix rounds) | fresh implementer dispatch every fix round | resume the implementer rounds 1–3, fresh one tier up at 4–5 | resume needs an addressable live subagent — most of our supported harnesses may lack it; fresh dispatch also strengthens external-signal verification and avoids the author defending their own defect (ADR-0064) |
| **subagent-driven-development** (workspace) | SDD workspace, task briefs, and review packages live under `.internal/sdd/<plan-basename>/` (self-ignored) | `.superpowers/sdd/<plan-basename>/` | one canonical `.internal/` scratch root (spec 2026-06-30); upstream's per-plan workspace shape adopted, path not — do not revert the path on re-sync |
| **subagent-driven-development** (breaker trip) | controller adjudicates nothing — findings are filed and surfaced, the user decides | controller adjudicates each open finding, may park minors | Production-Grade Doctrine: descoping authority is the human's |
| **subagent-driven-development** (severity) | severity preserved at the breaker; security findings block the epic and are never parkable | findings flattened into one disposition list | the reviewer's own security floor says a rationale never downgrades a regression |
| **subagent-driven-development** (re-review) | PASS requires the reviewer's verdict AND a green full suite | reviewer's verdict alone | a fix-diff reviewer structurally cannot see out-of-diff regressions |
| **subagent-driven-development** (fix context) | fix round carries only the latest report section | full prior report | full history is quadratic across rounds and re-anchors fresh eyes on failed approaches |
| **test-driven-development** `writing-good-tests.md` | fork retains three classes of source-text assertion: **absence-of-defect pins** (fail only if a named defect returns), **security-floor pins** (credential prefixes the handoff skill must redact), and **CHANGE-DETECTOR presence pins** (~27 explicitly-labelled pins across `tests/skills/test-getting-up-to-speed-contract.sh`, `test-kb-triggers.sh`, and `test-session-handoff-contract.sh`, retained under the deletion bar — a pin may go only once converted to behavioral or covered by a bead in the external `cc-eval` tracker). Adoption also drops upstream's `(superpowers:writing-skills)` parenthetical — a dead cross-plugin reference, since `writing-skills` isn't shipped here and a bare `superpowers:` namespace resolves to the upstream plugin — the file's one deliberate deviation from byte-identical | upstream's Warning Signs forbid all source-text assertions | our shipped artifacts *are* prose that instructs agents, and no eval-harness consumes them yet; deleting the redaction pins would be an automatic Reject under the audit rubric's security floor, and deleting the change-detector pins on faith would convert a false alarm into false silence on real breakage. Adopt the six rules and the traps; keep these three classes. Mark SKIP, not Conflict |
| **All shared skills** (guardrail heading) | guardrail sections are named `## Red Flags` | v6.2.0 renamed several to `## Common Rationalizations` (`using-git-worktrees`, `requesting-code-review`) | `## Red Flags` is a literal alternate in `scripts/check-guardrail-floor.sh`'s `PAT`; renaming a heading silently drops that skill's guardrail count and can trip — or worse, quietly relax — the floor. Adopt upstream's *rows*, keep our *heading*. Mark SKIP, not Conflict |
| **brainstorming, writing-plans** (companion files) | not shipped — no `spec-document-reviewer-prompt.md` / `plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md` | still ships both files (v6.2.0, `skills/brainstorming/` and `skills/writing-plans/`) | orphans upstream — nothing dispatches them; upstream's own `writing-plans/SKILL.md` Self-Review section says self-review is "not a subagent dispatch"; upstream RELEASE-NOTES v5.0.6 (2026-03-24) records their deprecation in favor of inline self-review (~25 min subagent-review overhead vs. ~30s self-review, no measurable quality difference). Check 5.4 will list them as new companion files every audit — mark SKIP (known-dead), not missing capability |

When a CHANGED skill from Phase 5 matches a row here, mark it **SKIP (deliberate divergence)** in the report — not drift.

## The Audit Process

You MUST create an audit bead and complete ALL 8 phases in order:

```bash
bd create "Audit: full plugin health check" -t chore -p 1
bd update <audit-id> --claim
```

---

**Check suite — Phases 1–3 (Plugin Infrastructure Health, Test Execution, Content Integrity):** the runnable check commands (manifests, versions, tests, content-integrity greps) live in [references/check-suite.md](references/check-suite.md) — open when executing the audit's check phases.

Done when: every check in Phases 1–3 reports PASS, or each FAIL is fixed before continuing.

---

### Phase 4: Progressive Skill Chain Integrity

The skills form a pipeline. Every link must be intact.

```bash
echo "=== Progressive Skill Chain ==="

# brainstorming → writing-plans (terminal state)
grep -q "writing-plans" skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: brainstorming → writing-plans" || echo "FAIL"

# writing-plans → subagent-driven-development OR executing-plans
grep -q "subagent-driven-development" skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: writing-plans → subagent-driven-dev" || echo "FAIL"
grep -q "executing-plans" skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: writing-plans → executing-plans" || echo "FAIL"

# subagent-driven-development → finishing-a-development-branch
grep -q "finishing-a-development-branch" skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: subagent-driven-dev → finishing" || echo "FAIL"

# executing-plans → finishing-a-development-branch
grep -q "finishing-a-development-branch" skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: executing-plans → finishing" || echo "FAIL"

# finishing-a-development-branch has Land the Plane
grep -q "Land the Plane" skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: finishing has Land the Plane" || echo "FAIL"

# using-superpowers has ## Beads section
grep -q "^## Beads" skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: bootstrap has beads awareness" || echo "FAIL"

# verification-before-completion has Beads Completion section
grep -q "Beads Completion" skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: verification has beads completion" || echo "FAIL"
```

Done when: every chain-link check reports PASS, or each FAIL is fixed.

---

### Phase 5: Upstream Superpowers Drift

Clone upstream and compare.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git /tmp/superpowers-upstream
```

**Check 5.1 — Version gap:**
```bash
upstream_ver=$(grep '"version"' /tmp/superpowers-upstream/package.json | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
echo "Upstream: v$upstream_ver | Our baseline: v6.2.0"
```

**Check 5.2 — New skills in upstream:**
```bash
diff <(ls /tmp/superpowers-upstream/skills/) <(ls skills/) | grep "^<"
# Lines starting with < are skills upstream has that we don't
```

For each new skill: assess if relevant (skip platform-specific ones).

**Check 5.3 — Content changes in shared skills:**
```bash
for skill in /tmp/superpowers-upstream/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
    name=$(basename $(dirname "$skill"))
    if [ -f "skills/$name/SKILL.md" ]; then
        changes=$(diff "$skill" "skills/$name/SKILL.md" | wc -l)
        [ "$changes" -gt 0 ] && echo "CHANGED: $name ($changes diff lines)"
    fi
done
```

For changed skills, categorise each:
- **Safe merge**: Change doesn't touch our beads-integrated sections
- **Conflict**: Change touches our modified sections → manual review
- **New content**: New sections added → assess and add with beads awareness

**Before categorising, check [Known Deliberate Divergences](#known-deliberate-divergences)** — skills listed there are *expected* to be CHANGED; mark them SKIP (deliberate divergence), not Conflict.

**Check 5.4 — New companion files:**
```bash
for dir in /tmp/superpowers-upstream/skills/*/; do
    name=$(basename "$dir")
    if [ -d "skills/$name" ]; then
        new_files=$(diff <(ls "$dir" 2>/dev/null | sort) <(ls "skills/$name" 2>/dev/null | sort) | grep "^<" | sed 's/^< //')
        [ -n "$new_files" ] && echo "NEW FILES in $name: $new_files"
    fi
done
```

**Check 5.5 — Hook and manifest changes:**
```bash
diff /tmp/superpowers-upstream/hooks/hooks.json hooks/hooks.json | head -20
diff /tmp/superpowers-upstream/.claude-plugin/plugin.json .claude-plugin/plugin.json | head -20
```

Our hook is intentionally different (composes beads context — curated memories + a `bd prime` pointer). Check for structural changes, new hook types, or new manifest fields.

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/superpowers-upstream
```

Done when: Checks 5.1–5.5 are run and every CHANGED skill is categorised (Safe merge / Conflict / New content / SKIP deliberate divergence).

---

### Phase 6: Upstream Beads Drift

Check if beads has new capabilities our skills should use.

**Check 6.1 — Beads version:**
```bash
bd version
# Compare against our baseline (v1.1.0)
```

**Check 6.2 — New or changed bd commands:**
```bash
bd --help 2>&1 | head -60
# Look for new commands not in our skills' Quick Reference tables
```

**Check 6.3 — bd prime format:**
```bash
bd prime 2>&1 | head -20
# Compare structure against what hooks/session-start expects
```

**Check 6.4 — New beads features to watch:**
- New dependency types → update `bd dep add` references
- New issue types → update `bd create -t` references
- New status codes → update lifecycle references
- New CLI flags → update quick reference tables
- Changes to gate/molecule/formula system → assess skill impact
- **Version-stamped schema kernels:** on any bd version bump, `grep -rn "verified at bd v" skills/` and re-verify each stamped schema paragraph against the new binary (`--help` + `--dry-run` probe); update the stamp or file a fix bead.

Done when: bd version, new/changed commands, and `bd prime` format are compared against baseline, and Check 6.4's watch areas are assessed for skill impact.

---

### Phase 6b: Upstream mex Drift

Check whether mex changed under the pinned 0.7.1 baseline. The knowledge layer is load-bearing: skills, the session-start hook, and `project-init` all encode this CLI's shapes.

**Check 6b.1 — mex version:**
```bash
mex --version    # bare semver, no `v` prefix
# Compare against our baseline: 0.7.1 (pinned; Node >= 22.5.0)
```

**Check 6b.2 — command surface:**
```bash
mex --help 2>&1 | head -40
mex setup --help; mex log --help; mex check --help
# Look for a non-interactive setup flag appearing (--yes/--non-interactive), new `mex log --type` values,
# and any change to `mex graph scope` JSONL line grammar (meta / fact / summary).
```

**Check 6b.3 — the three exit-code traps (re-verify, never assume fixed):**
- `mex setup </dev/null` exits **0** with a partial scaffold (no `config.json`, no `graph.db`).
- `mex sync` exits **0** having repaired nothing when errors are present and stdin is closed.
- `mex check` exits **0** with warnings; a stock scaffold scores 79/100 with 7 warnings.

If any of these changes, `project-init`, `mex-curator`, and `finishing-a-development-branch` all carry text that must be updated with it.

**Check 6b.4 — layout and language coverage:**
- Paths: `.mex/context/decisions.md` (prose, created by setup) vs `.mex/events/decisions.jsonl` (created lazily by the first `mex log`).
- Product-added pages mex neither creates nor reads: `.mex/lessons.md`, `.mex/lessons-archive.md`, `.mex/private/`. A release that starts creating or reading them is a `project-init` change.
- `mex graph` language coverage — JS/TS/Python observed at 0.7.1 (dot-directories excluded), Rust claimed upstream but unexercised. Re-probe before widening the claim in `docs/en/memory.md`.

Done when: mex version, command surface, the three exit-code traps, and the layout/coverage claims are compared against baseline, and any delta is traced to the skills and docs that encode it.

---

### Phase 7: Documentation Accuracy

Verify all documentation reflects the current state.

**Check 7.1 — README skills count matches actual:**
```bash
actual=$(ls -d skills/*/ | wc -l)
readme_count=$(grep -o "[0-9]* skills" README.md | head -1 | grep -o "[0-9]*")
echo "Actual: $actual | README: $readme_count"
[ "$actual" = "$readme_count" ] && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: README skills count is stale"
```

**Check 7.2 — README skills table has all skills:**
```bash
for dir in skills/*/; do
    name=$(basename "$dir")
    grep -q "$name" README.md && echo "PASS: $name in README" || echo "FAIL: $name missing from README"
done
```

**Check 7.3 — CHANGELOG has current version:**
```bash
version=$(grep '"version"' package.json | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
grep -q "\[$version\]" CHANGELOG.md && echo "PASS: v$version in CHANGELOG" || echo "FAIL: v$version missing from CHANGELOG"
```

**Check 7.4 — CLAUDE.md skills table matches actual:**
```bash
for dir in skills/*/; do
    name=$(basename "$dir")
    grep -q "$name" CLAUDE.md && echo "PASS: $name in CLAUDE.md" || echo "FAIL: $name missing from CLAUDE.md"
done
```

**Check 7.5 — SETUP-GUIDE install commands use correct names:**
```bash
grep -q "strider4560/beads-superpowers" .internal/SETUP-GUIDE.md && echo "PASS: correct marketplace repo" || echo "FAIL"
grep -q "beads-superpowers@beads-superpowers-marketplace" .internal/SETUP-GUIDE.md && echo "PASS: correct install command" || echo "FAIL"
```

**Check 7.6 — Copied upstream docs don't have stale references:**
```bash
# These docs were adapted from superpowers — verify no stale refs
for f in .internal/testing.md .internal/windows/polyglot-hooks.md; do
    stale=$(grep -c "superpowers" "$f" | head -1)
    allowed=$(grep -c "beads-superpowers\|obra/superpowers\|upstream" "$f" | head -1)
    raw=$((stale - allowed))
    [ "$raw" -le 0 ] && echo "PASS: $f clean" || echo "WARNING: $f may have $raw stale superpowers refs"
done
```

**Check 7.7 — Upstream Beads docs links in docs/ resolve (visible SKIP offline; ADR-0041-era descope net):**
```bash
if ! command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1 || ! curl -sf -o /dev/null --max-time 10 "https://gastownhall.github.io/beads/"; then
  echo "SKIP (no curl or no network): upstream docs link-check not run"
else
  grep -rhoE 'https://gastownhall\.github\.io/beads[^") ]*' docs/*.md | sort -u | while read -r url; do
    code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -L --max-time 10 "$url")
    if [ "${code#2}" = "$code" ]; then  # not 2xx — retry once
      code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -L --max-time 10 "$url")
    fi
    case "$code" in 2*) echo "PASS: $url" ;; *) echo "FAIL ($code): $url" ;; esac
  done
fi
```

Done when: Checks 7.1–7.7 all report PASS, or each FAIL is fixed.

---

### Phase 8: Generate Audit Report

Create beads for each finding and write the report.

```bash
# Create child beads for each finding
bd create "Drift: [description]" -t chore -p 3 --parent <audit-id>
bd create "CRITICAL: [description]" -t bug -p 0 --parent <audit-id>
```

Write the report to `.internal/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-upstream-drift.md`:

```markdown
# Plugin Audit — YYYY-MM-DD

## Infrastructure
- Plugin manifest: PASS/FAIL
- Version consistency: PASS/FAIL (version)
- Hook functional: PASS/FAIL
- Settings.json: PASS/FAIL
- Skills count: N
- LICENSE: PASS/FAIL

## Tests
- Brainstorm server: N/32 passed
- WS protocol: N/31 passed
- Auth/security: N/20 passed
- Fast skill tests: PASS/FAIL (N subtests)
- Integration test: RAN/SKIPPED

## Content Integrity
- TodoWrite residue: PASS/FAIL
- Stale paths: PASS/FAIL
- Stale namespaces: PASS/FAIL
- Beads density: N references (min 30)
- Subagent isolation: PASS/FAIL
- Skill chain: PASS/FAIL

## Upstream Drift
- Superpowers: vX.Y.Z (baseline v6.2.0) — N changes
- Beads: vX.Y.Z (baseline v1.1.0) — N new features
- mex: X.Y.Z (baseline 0.7.1) — N changes; exit-code traps re-verified: Y/N
- New skills: N (action: copy/skip for each)
- Changed skills: N (action: merge/conflict/skip for each)

## Documentation
- README: PASS/FAIL
- CHANGELOG: PASS/FAIL
- CLAUDE.md: PASS/FAIL
- SETUP-GUIDE: PASS/FAIL
- Copied docs: PASS/FAIL

## Findings: N total (C critical, I important, M minor)

## Actions Required
- [List with bead IDs]
```

Close the audit bead:
```bash
bd close <audit-id> --reason "Audit complete: N findings (C critical, I important, M minor)"
```

Done when: findings beads are created, the report is written to `.internal/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-upstream-drift.md`, and the audit bead is closed with evidence.

---

## Quick Audit (Phases 1-4 Only)

For fast checks without upstream comparison:

```bash
# Run this single block for a quick health check
echo "=== Quick Audit ===" && \
claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json 2>&1 | tail -1 && \
test -x hooks/session-start && echo "Hook: executable" && \
bash hooks/session-start 2>&1 | python3 -m json.tool > /dev/null && echo "Hook: valid JSON" && \
echo "Skills: $(ls -d skills/*/ | wc -l)" && \
echo "TodoWrite residue: $(grep -rn 'TodoWrite' skills/ | grep -v 'Do NOT use' | grep -v 'replaces' | grep -v 'auditing-upstream-drift' | wc -l)" && \
echo "Stale paths: $(grep -rn 'docs/superpowers' skills/ tests/ | grep -v 'auditing-upstream-drift' | wc -l)" && \
echo "Stale namespace: $(grep -rn '"superpowers:' skills/ tests/ | grep -v 'beads-superpowers:' | wc -l)" && \
echo "Beads density: $(grep -rn 'bd create\|bd close\|bd ready\|bd update\|bd dep\|bd dolt' skills/ | wc -l)" && \
echo "Version: $(grep '"version"' package.json | grep -o '[0-9.]*')" && \
cd tests/brainstorm-server && node server.test.js 2>&1 | tail -1 && node ws-protocol.test.js 2>&1 | tail -1 && node auth.test.js 2>&1 | tail -1 && cd ../.. && \
echo "=== Quick Audit Complete ==="
```

## Audit Frequency

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Before any plugin release | Full audit (Phases 1-8, including 6b) — MANDATORY |
| Monthly | Phases 1-4 (infrastructure + tests + content + chain) |
| After upstream superpowers release | Add Phase 5 |
| After upstream beads release | Add Phase 6 |
| After an upstream mex release | Add Phase 6b |
| After bulk skill edits | Phases 2-4 (tests + content + chain) |
| After test refactoring | Phase 2 only (run all tests) |
| User reports mismatch | Phase 3 check 3.x for the specific issue + Phase 5 check 5.3 for the skill |
| Quick sanity check | Quick Audit block above |

## Cleanup

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/superpowers-upstream
```

**Capture what you learned.** At close, record durable, evidence-backed insights (still true next month, tied to a file, test, or command) in `.mex/lessons.md`: one bullet per lesson, prefixed by kind (`lesson:` / `pattern:` / `root-cause:` / `correction:`), with the evidence named. Update an existing entry in place rather than adding a near-duplicate. The hot page is hard-capped at 2048 bytes — if an append would exceed it, demote the coldest entries to `.mex/lessons-archive.md` (retrievable via the router, not injected) until it fits. Decisions: `mex log --type decision "<one-line decision>"` always (bare `mex log` records kind "note", not a decision); add a full `docs/decisions/ADR-NNNN-<kebab>.md` (+ `INDEX.md`) only when the ADR bar is met (hard-to-reverse AND surprising-without-context AND genuine trade-off). Requirements, design rationale, and compliance durables: distill into the matching `.mex/` page. Durables that name an unmitigated risk, security gap, compliance exposure, or unreleased plan go to `.mex/private/` (gitignored), never to tracked pages. Never record guesses, one-offs, or secrets (tokens, keys, PII — the hot page is injected into all future sessions, and tracked `.mex/` pages are public in public repos); scan before writing.

## Integration

**Invoked by:** No other skill invokes this directly. Standalone audit skill — run before releases or on-demand.

**Invokes:** None. References other skills as audit targets but does not invoke them.
