# beads-superpowers — Agent Instructions

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, plus project-specific instructions.

> **Canonical agent-instruction file for all harnesses.** `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file. Sections that name a specific harness (e.g. the Claude Code plugin cache, DCI in `SKILL.md`) apply only to that harness — other agents can skip them. **Windows note:** `AGENTS.md` is a git symlink; on Windows enable `git config core.symlinks true` (or Developer Mode) before cloning, or it checks out as a text file containing the path.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Project Overview

A plugin for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode (verified) plus 7 best-effort harnesses — Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Kimi Code, Antigravity, Factory Droid, and Pi — that merges [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills (v6.1.1) with [Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) issue tracking (v1.1.0). It gives AI coding agents composable process-discipline skills (TDD, brainstorming, systematic debugging, code review, verification) plus persistent task memory via a Dolt-backed database.

**Repository:** <https://github.com/DollarDill/beads-superpowers>
**Version:** 0.15.0
**License:** MIT (fork of obra/superpowers, also MIT)

## Architecture

- `.claude-plugin/` — Claude Code plugin manifest (`plugin.json`) and marketplace config (`marketplace.json`). Auto-discovered by Claude Code.
- `.codex-plugin/` — Codex CLI plugin manifest (`plugin.json`) and marketplace config (`marketplace.json`). Mirrors `.claude-plugin/` for Codex compatibility. The repo-root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` (version-less) is the Codex marketplace source manifest — without it, Codex marketplace sources find zero installable plugins.
- `skills/` — one skill per `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directory. Some include prompt templates (`implementer-prompt.md`, `researcher-prompt.md`) or helper scripts. Auto-discovered by Claude Code — do NOT declare in `plugin.json`.
- `agents/` — Removed in v0.6.0. Code-reviewer is now dispatched via `skills/requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md` prompt template. Subagents (implementer, researcher) use prompt templates inside their skills, not standalone agent files.
- `hooks/` — `session-start` (SessionStart: injects `using-superpowers` + composed beads context — curated memories + a `bd prime` pointer), the single recurring hook. Multi-format output supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and generic CLIs. Registered in `hooks/hooks.json` (Claude Code) and `hooks/codex-hooks.json` (Codex). Auto-discovered.
- `.opencode/` — OpenCode plugin (`plugins/beads-superpowers.js`, upstream-parity base + beads graft) + `INSTALL.md`. Git-install only via the opencode.json plugin spec; `install.sh` no longer copies OpenCode artifacts (its `--uninstall` still cleans pre-0.12 copies).
- `example-workflow/` — Ready-to-use project template: `agents/yegge.md` (lean router — triages requests and routes to skills). `install.sh --with-yegge` installs `yegge.md` globally (opt-in; not installed by default).
- `docs/` — Docs content only, i18n folder layout: `docs/en/` (English pages) + `docs/zh/` (Chinese mirrors, 1:1 structural parity guard-enforced) + shared `docs/assets/`. Source of truth for the site's prose. The site itself is built and published from the private the-factory-website repo (`tenants/beads-superpowers/`), not from this repo (ADR-0050).
- `docs/decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Local working docs (gitignored).
- `.internal/` — Working docs (gitignored): specs from brainstorming, plans from writing-plans, research output, audits, reference docs, `.internal/sdd/` (SDD scratch), and `.internal/brainstorm/` (brainstorm server sessions).
- `tests/` — deterministic suites (hooks, manifests, skills contracts, install-shape, installer docker/podman E2E, brainstorm-server Node tests) run via the `just` surface. (The 4 LLM-driven suites were removed in the 2026-07 fat audit — successor: the external eval-harness project.)
- `scripts/` — `bump-version.sh` (sync version across all surfaces declared in `.version-bump.json` — JSON manifests + prose), `check-skill-count.sh` (guard: forbid hardcoded skill counts + structural self-consistency), `check-agent-bead-stamp.sh`, `check-zh-docs.sh`, `check-convention-sync.sh` (verify shared convention blocks are byte-identical across skills), `lint-shell.sh` (shellcheck gate over tracked `.sh` with committed baseline; visible SKIP when shellcheck absent), `check-askuser-genericization.sh` (guard: skills use generic question-tool phrasing — ADR-0041), `check-model-genericization.sh` (guard: no hardcoded Claude model names in harness-neutral content — capability tiers only), `check-guardrail-floor.sh` (guard: ADR-0049's "never remove to zero" made mechanical — counts guardrail lines per skill against the committed `guardrail-floor-baseline.txt` and fails on a drop to zero or an unjustified decrease; a recorded `0` is a legitimate, disclosed zero for capability skills with no bright lines).
- `install.sh` — curl installer with 3-tier fallback chain (plugin system → npx → tarball/git clone). SHA-256 checksum validation, atomic rollback via staging directory, lazy prerequisites. Auto-detects Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and 7 more CLIs (Cursor, Copilot, Droid, Antigravity, Kimi, Pi, Gemini).

## Key Design Decisions

- **Skills are pure Markdown** — No executable code in skills. Claude Code auto-discovers `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Platform-agnostic by design. (See: upstream superpowers architecture)
- **Prompt templates over standalone agent files** — Subagent prompts (`implementer-prompt.md`, `researcher-prompt.md`) live inside their skills. Only the orchestrator (`yegge.md`) is a standalone agent file. Prevents drift between skill and dispatch instructions. (See: ADR-0003)
- **`bd` replaces TodoWrite everywhere** — Every `TodoWrite` reference in upstream superpowers replaced with `bd` commands. Beads provides persistent cross-session memory that TodoWrite lacks.
- **Three-layer architecture for example workflow** — `CLAUDE.md` (behavioral principles + project context) + `agents/yegge.md` (orchestration — triage + skill routing) + prompt templates (subagent dispatch). Each layer has a distinct responsibility. (See: ADR-0003, ADR-0032)
- **`yegge.md` is opt-in and never load-bearing** — it installs only via `install.sh --with-yegge` (Claude Code only, absent from a default install). It MUST NOT be counted when reasoning about, auditing, or claiming whole-product behaviour, and MUST NOT be cited as evidence that the product enforces something. Any behaviour that matters has to hold on a default install — the session-start hook plus `skills/` — where `yegge.md` may reinforce a rule but never supply it. **If a rule exists only in `yegge.md`, the product does not have that rule.** Same test for any other opt-in surface.
- **MkDocs Material for docs site** — HashiCorp/Terraform-style sidebar, dark theme, Mermaid diagrams. Template variables via macros plugin avoid hardcoded counts; the config and macros now live in the-factory-website repo, not here. (See: ADR-0001, ADR-0050)
- **Per-task worktree isolation for parallel SDD** — Independent plan tasks execute in parallel (max 5), each in its own `bd worktree`. Prevents merge conflicts between concurrent subagents. (See: ADR-0002)
- **Dev-branch integration model** — All work lands on `dev`; `main` is released-only and advances exclusively via `git merge --ff-only dev` at release cut (hotfixes ride dev as patch releases — drift is self-detecting). `main` carries force-push/deletion protection (`gh-pages` did too until its 2026-07-22 retirement). (See: ADR-0060)

## Common Gotchas

- **Embedded Dolt mode** — `.beads/metadata.json` `dolt_mode: embedded` runs the Dolt engine **in-process** (no separate sql-server). This does NOT disable sync: `bd dolt status/show/push/pull` all work. The remote is the dedicated private repo `DollarDill/beads-superpowers-beads` (slug only — content is auth-gated), decoupled from this public code repo (ADR-0057); the code repo itself carries **zero** dolt refs — any reappearing is a regression (`bash skills/project-init/scripts/diagnose.sh` flags it). New-machine bootstrap: clone this repo, then `bd init --non-interactive --prefix beads-superpowers --remote "git+ssh://git@github.com/DollarDill/beads-superpowers-beads.git"` — hydrates the full DB from the private remote. Genuine push failures are setup-specific (diverged history, GitHub push-protection if a token is in Dolt history) — see the `project-init` skill, not a blanket "embedded fails".
- **Zero-remote `bd dolt push` silently adopts git origin (bd v1.1.0)** — with NO Dolt remote configured, `bd dolt push` does not error; it silently pushes the beads DB to the git origin instead (a real, reproduced ADR-0057 incident). Always chain remote swaps in one command — `bd dolt remote remove origin && bd dolt remote add origin <url>` — never leave the remote empty between the two.
- **Remote swaps: collision guard + stale `sync.remote`** — bd releases after v1.1.0 refuse `bd dolt remote add` with a URL matching git origin unless `--allow-git-origin` is passed (upstream PR #4153, merged post-v1.1.0-tag); don't fight this for a deliberate same-repo setup, pass the flag. Separately, `bd dolt remote remove` can leave `sync.remote` stale or commented out in `.beads/config.yaml` — verify it after any swap and repair with `bd config set sync.remote <url>` if it's wrong.
- **Reference-class knowledge lives in beads, not `bd memories`** — the `memory-curator` taxonomy makes `@type` the routing decision: `research`/`design`/`decision` notes (pointers to docs/ADRs) become **deferred knowledge-beads** (`status=deferred`, far-future `defer_until`, GC-safe, hidden from `bd ready`) tagged with the `kb` label + 1–3 topic labels, while `lesson`/`pattern`/`root-cause`/`correction` stay injected memories. Retrieve by topic with `bd list --label <topic> --status all` or by keyword with `bd search "<keyword>" --status all` (titles only — body terms need `--desc-contains "<term>"`); read hit bodies with multi-id `bd show` or `bd list … --flat --long -n 10` before relying on them; retire stale entries with `bd supersede <old> --with <new>`. `bd memories <keyword>` only covers injected memories.
- **`export.git-add` pollutes branches (v1.0.2 and earlier)** — In beads v1.0.2 and earlier, `export.git-add` defaulted to `true`, auto-staging `issues.jsonl` on every commit. Workaround: `bd config set export.git-add false` before branch work. In **v1.0.4+**, auto-export is opt-in by default — no workaround needed. Check with `bd config show`.
- **DCI only works in SKILL.md** — The `!` backtick syntax (Dynamic Context Injection) only works in `SKILL.md` and `.claude/commands/*.md`. NOT in agent `.md` files, `CLAUDE.md`, or rules files.
- **Never run `npx skills add` from inside this repo** — It replaces real skill files in `skills/` with symlinks to `.agents/skills/`, destroying the source. Use `-g` flag from `/tmp` or another directory.
- **Never chain `open` after `bd` commands** — `open <file>` hangs when chained in the same Bash invocation with `bd` commands. Always run `open` as a standalone call.
- **Worktree path default** — `bd worktree create <name>` creates at `./<name>` (sibling to repo files), NOT `.worktrees/<name>`. Pass the full path: `bd worktree create .worktrees/<name>`.
- **Worktree detection** — Use `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, NOT `[ -d .git ]`. In a worktree, `.git` is a file, not a directory.
- **Plugin cache goes stale** — After modifying skills, the installed plugin cache is outdated. Symlink the cache to this repo. `claude plugin update` has a [cache bug](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14061).
- **Skill `description` field trap** — Putting workflow descriptions in skill `description` frontmatter causes Claude to follow the description instead of reading the full skill body (SDO problem). Descriptions should state trigger conditions only.
- **Codex plugin channel doesn't register hooks** — codex-cli (verified 0.142.5) rejects a populated `hooks` object in the plugin manifest ("ignoring hooks: … found object") and auto-discovers nothing usable, so plugin/marketplace installs get skills but NO SessionStart hook. `install.sh` wires the hook explicitly — it is the supported Codex hook path.
- **`gh-pages` is retired — do not recreate it (ADR-0050, 2nd amendment)** — the SEO redirect bridge was sunset early on 2026-07-22 (maintainer call: algocents.com had begun ranking for the target terms). GitHub Pages is unpublished, the branch and its protection are deleted, and `scripts/verify-ghpages-stubs.sh` is gone. The full pre-deletion history — stub tree plus the original MkDocs site at `2c2ebc5` — is preserved on the tag `archive/gh-pages-final`. `https://dollardill.github.io/beads-superpowers/*` now 404s permanently; the live site is algocents.com.

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging:

```bash
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

> **Note:** Claude Code auto-discovers `skills/`, `agents/`, and `hooks/` by convention — do NOT declare these paths in `plugin.json` (it causes validation failures). The directory layout is documented in the **Architecture** section above.

## Beads Integration

This plugin uses `bd` (beads) for ALL task tracking.

### Commands

`bd human` is the SSOT for bd commands and flags (read `bd <cmd> --help` on first use). Command tables are not restated here.

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — never TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODOs
- Never guess bd syntax — on first use of a command or flag this session, read `bd <cmd> --help` (the binary is SSOT)
- Only the orchestrating agent manages beads — subagents do NOT touch beads
- Include bead IDs in commit messages: `git commit -m "Add feature (bd-a1b2)"`
- Every session ends with Land the Plane: `bd close` → `bd dolt push` → `git push` (work lands on `dev`; `main` only advances at release cut)
- Beads *policy* is embedded where it's read — using-superpowers' Beads section plus inline own-operation kernels (no dedicated policy skill); bd *commands* defer to `bd human` — don't restate command tables in skills

## Modifying Skills

### Modifying an Existing Skill

1. **Compress to strongest rows, positive-framed (ADR-0049):** All skills follow this pattern. Collapse redundant *corrections*, but retain every distinct rationalization *phrase* verbatim — the model pattern-matches on specific phrasing. Never reduce a skill's guardrail content (anti-rationalization tables, Iron Laws, Red Flags sections) to zero; mechanically enforced by `bash scripts/check-guardrail-floor.sh`
2. **Do NOT add** TodoWrite references — use `bd` commands
3. Verify after changes: run `bash scripts/check-todowrite.sh` — must report "No active TodoWrite references"

### Key Anti-Patterns

- Putting workflow descriptions in skill `description` fields (causes Claude to follow description instead of reading full skill — the skill-discovery finding in docs/en/research.md; mechanism note in docs/en/methodology.md)
- Softening bright-line rules ("consider" instead of "MUST")
- Adding platform-specific code to skills (skills are pure Markdown)

## Build & Test

Skills are plain Markdown. Docs content lives in `docs/`; the site is built and published by the-factory-website (ADR-0050).

### Validation — the `just` surface (tool, not gate)

Run `just check` after touching harness plumbing (hooks/, install.sh, manifests, .opencode/).
Pre-commit covers commit-time hygiene; nothing here is CI-enforced by design.

```bash
just            # = just check: guards + hooks + manifests + contracts + shape
just guards     # all guard scripts (todowrite, bead-stamp, zh-docs, convention-sync,
                #   skill-count + KNOWN_SKILLS drift, version sync, frontmatter, shell lint,
                #   askuser-genericization, model-genericization, guardrail floor)
just lint       # shellcheck gate alone (tracked .sh, baseline'd; SKIPs if shellcheck absent)
just hooks      # tests/hooks/* (node tests SKIP visibly if node absent)
just shape      # install-shape: 10 harnesses (Tier A full artifacts; Tier B hint+manifest)
just shape codex  # one harness
just selftest   # guard-the-guards: mutations that must fail
just server     # brainstorm-server Node tests (opt-in)
just docker     # installer E2E under docker or podman (opt-in, slow)
```

docs preview: from the-factory-website repo (tenants/beads-superpowers)

```bash
# Verify beads integration (should be 30+)
grep -r "bd create\|bd close\|bd ready" skills/ | wc -l
```

For a quick, no-Docker installer smoke test outside the `just` surface: `bash install.sh --test`
(installs to `/tmp`, verifies, cleans up).

Skill *behavior* testing lives in the external eval-harness project (the in-repo LLM suites
were removed in the 2026-07 fat audit).

**Release process (no GHA):** run the `document-release` docs audit **on dev** (release cuts bypass the finishing-branch Step 3.5 docs gate) → `./scripts/bump-version.sh <ver>` + update CHANGELOG, committed **on dev** →
`git switch main && git merge --ff-only dev` (fails loudly if anything ever landed on main directly — that's the invariant working) → tag `v<ver>` on main → `git push --tags` → **publish the GitHub Release**:
`gh release create v<ver> --title "v<ver>" --latest --notes-file <changelog-section> checksums.txt` → `git switch dev`.
Publishing the GitHub Release is NOT optional — `install.sh` resolves its default version from `releases/latest`,
so a pushed tag without a published Release leaves installers on the previous version. Attach
`checksums.txt` (`sha256sum` of the tag tarball `archive/refs/tags/v<ver>.tar.gz`) or
`verify_checksum` silently skips. Docs deploy is no longer part of this repo's release process — the site publishes from the private the-factory-website repo (ADR-0050).

Fixes on dev reach installers only at release — cut patch releases promptly. main receives nothing except ff-only merges from dev; hotfixes ride dev as patch releases.

## Version Management

Version surfaces are declared in `.version-bump.json` and must stay in sync:

- `package.json`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.codex-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.kimi-plugin/plugin.json`
- `CLAUDE.md` (`**Version:**` line — prose entry)

README version badges are dynamic (shields.io release badge) — no hand-sync needed.

Use `scripts/bump-version.sh` to update all at once:

```bash
./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.5.3        # Bump to new version
./scripts/bump-version.sh --check      # Detect version drift
```

## Example Workflow

The `example-workflow/` directory provides a ready-to-use development workflow:
