# beads-superpowers

beads-superpowers gives AI coding agents composable skills that enforce process discipline - TDD, systematic debugging, design before code, code review - plus a persistent issue tracker that carries context across sessions. The skills come from [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers); the tracker from [Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads).

## Where to start

- **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** - install the plugin and `bd`, per harness, then run your first session.
- **[Example Workflow](workflow.md)** - the orchestrator that routes a request through the pipeline, from triage to finish.
- **[Philosophy](philosophy.md)** - why the plugin behaves the way it does: the design decisions behind it, not the day-to-day mechanics.
- **[Memory & Sessions](memory.md)** - the durable-knowledge architecture: what gets injected at session start, and how knowledge is retrieved, captured, and curated.
- **[Methodology](methodology.md)** - the problem each upstream project solved, and how the two combine into one mechanism.
- **[Skills Reference](skills.md)** - the full per-skill reference: what each skill does and when it triggers.
- **[Research](research.md)** - the literature and the project's own measurements behind each design choice.
- **[Tips & Tricks](tips.md)** - day-to-day operational tips: the `bd` cheat sheet and fixes for common issues.
