# check-convention-sync.sh — keep the cross-cutting convention blocks in sync across every
# site that carries them. Free-form duplication rots (bd-6814 ADR-strip missed skills/; the
# TodoWrite gate drifted across 4 sites). Two tiers:
#   * Canonical BLOCKS — CB-3 (Capture gate) and CB-C (capture contract) must be
#     BYTE-IDENTICAL at every site: enforced by extract-and-diff (assert_block_identical /
#     assert_line_identical), backstopped by an ASCII signature-presence grep.
#   * Per-site FRAGMENT (CB-R read-depth) and KERNELS — only a fixed sentence / per-skill line
#     is shared, so signature-presence (`grep -qF`) is the correct check (the fragment IS the
#     whole shared unit; kernels are per-site by design).
# Any missing/divergent copy is DRIFT. Guard-the-guards: tests/install-shape/selftest.sh
# (Mutations 13-16).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-convention-sync.sh            # verify all sites (exit 1 on drift)
#   scripts/check-convention-sync.sh --self-test # prove the detector catches a mutated block
