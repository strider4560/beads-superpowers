name: getting-up-to-speed
description: Orients on an unfamiliar or stale codebase at the start of a session, after compaction, or whenever the project state is unclear. Loads beads context, deep-dives the codebase, and produces a structured 'current state' summary. Triggers on phrases like "catch me up", "where are we", "orient me", "what's the state of this project", "bring me up to speed", "load context", "session orientation".

# Getting Up to Speed

Orient on the project before any work: re-derive the current state from **ground truth** — commands run THIS session, never memory — and stop for the user's call.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the getting-up-to-speed skill to orient on the project."

**When NOT to use:** a single targeted question; already oriented this session and nothing changed; a fresh empty repo (use the `project-init` skill).

**frugal bd kernel:** bounded by selection and shape, not by a forbidden call — the mex section emits the hot page's head and one `mex check` line, never the whole store. `bd ready --claim` is FORBIDDEN here — orientation ends at the terminal contract and the user picks the work.

## Steps

Copy this checklist into your working response and tick as you go:

- [ ] 1 Gathered (orient.sh + handoff)
- [ ] 2 Explored (path by scale)
- [ ] 3 Drilled (top beads)
- [ ] 4 Closed (capture → prune → archive)
- [ ] 5 Summary emitted through the gate

**Summary-last.** Every tool call and every bookkeeping line lands before the summary; the summary block ends your response, where the user's eye already is.

### 1 — Gather (at most 2 tool calls)

Run `bash <skill-base-dir>/scripts/orient.sh` once. It emits raw labeled sections: `scale` (tracked=N, git=0|1), `ledger`, `ready`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `mex` (`ABSENT`, or `PRESENT` + a `check:` line carrying `mex check`'s exit code and first output line + the first 20 lines of `.mex/lessons.md`), `handoff` (`path=`, `head_sha=`, `doc_sha=`, `doc_mtime=`, `last_commit_time=`, `inbox_count=`). It never runs `bd dolt` commands — orientation stays read-only. If `== handoff ==` has a `path=` line, `Read` that file (the second call); quote only its short headline — never echo doc body sections that could carry secrets. The handoff is a synthesized narrative → cross-check it in step 4 and tag it ⚠️, never "verified".

- No `<beads-context>` block visible this session → run `bd prime` once before the script.
- bd missing / `.beads` absent → the script's bd branch reads SKIP (the `mex` section included): skip step 3 and the beads lines of the summary; emit "**Beads:** not installed — skipped", and read `.mex/lessons.md` directly if `.mex/` exists.

Done when: every orient.sh section is read, and the handoff is read or recorded as "none".

### 2 — Explore (one parallel batch — never serialize)

Pick the path from `tracked=`:

- **< 40 (Light):** top-level `find`, `git log --oneline -15` + `git status -sb` + top 5 tags, `Read` README.
- **40–150 (Medium, default):** Light + `Read` any of package.json/pyproject.toml/Cargo.toml/go.mod, CHANGELOG/CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, project manifests; `find` on skills/agents/docs/hooks/tests/src/lib that exist.
- **> 150 (Heavy):** dispatch two read-only `Subagent (general-purpose)` surveys in one message via the `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill — one reads CLAUDE.md/README/CHANGELOG and returns the architecture in <300 words; the other maps directory layout and per-directory file counts in <200 words. Both briefs are inline — state the scope, the word cap, and "report findings only, change nothing". Then read the 1–3 files they flag. If subagents are unavailable, run the Medium path instead and say so.

Done when: every planned read of the chosen path has returned.

### 3 — Drill (bounded)

`bd show <id> | head -30` on the top 3 open ready beads by priority — this feeds the "Relevant to ready work" line. The summary table still lists up to 10 from `bd ready`.

Done when: 3 beads drilled (or step skipped with reason).

### 4 — Close

1. Capture durable, evidence-backed insights per the capture contract (`mex-curator`): one `<kind>: <insight>` bullet appended to `.mex/lessons.md`, the evidence named. The hot page is hard-capped at 2048 bytes — if the append would exceed it, demote the coldest entries to `.mex/lessons-archive.md` first. A stale Phase-1 entry is updated in place, never left beside its replacement.
2. Prune continuation pointers in `.mex/lessons.md` to one: keep the entry paired with the doc read; remove the rest matching the `continuation-` **key prefix** only. Ambiguous keeper → keep ALL and skip (never guess-delete). Report: "Pruned N superseded continuation pointers; kept `<key>`."
3. Archive the consumed doc (only if one was read; AFTER the prune):
   `mkdir -p .internal/handoff/archive && mv -f "<doc>" .internal/handoff/archive/`
   Report "Archived consumed handoff `<name>` → `archive/`." — or on failure "⚠️ could not archive (<reason>); left in inbox" and continue (it self-heals next session). This mv is the skill's only local mutation.

Report all three on a **single short line**, then move to step 5. Skipping any of the three is fine; say which and why on that same line.

Done when: all three are reported (or explicitly skipped).

### 5 — Synthesize through the gate

Compute the cross-checks yourself (never delegated):

- **Working tree:** `git status --porcelain` + `git diff --numstat`; top-N by churn with `+X/-Y`, binary as `(binary)`, untracked as a count. Never dump the diff.
- **Continuity (in-progress beads only):** base branch from `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (fallback main/master); `git log --grep="<bead-id>" --oneline <base>` per bead. A hit is **advisory**: `⚠️ <bead> appears in <sha> on <base> — verify it shouldn't be closed`. No commit hit = NOT flagged. Deeper hygiene → point at `bd doctor` / `bd stale`.
- **Handoff freshness (if a doc was read):** compare its stated branch/sha/claims to live git+bd (divergence is advisory), then HEAD-recency from the `@ <sha>` token on its TL;DR branch line:

  ```bash
  DOC="<path>"; HEAD=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
  DOC_SHA=$(grep -m1 -oE '@ *[`*]*[0-9a-f]{7,40}' "$DOC" | grep -oE '[0-9a-f]{7,40}' | head -1)
  # An empty DOC_SHA must never reach the fresh arm: "$DOC_SHA"* would be a bare
  # wildcard matching any HEAD, which is why the -n guard leads every sha test.
  if [ -n "$DOC_SHA" ] && [ "${HEAD#"$DOC_SHA"}" != "$HEAD" ]; then echo fresh
  elif [ -n "$DOC_SHA" ] && git merge-base --is-ancestor "$DOC_SHA" HEAD 2>/dev/null; then echo possibly-stale
  else
    DOC_MTIME=$(stat -c %Y "$DOC" 2>/dev/null || stat -f %m "$DOC")
    [ -n "$DOC_MTIME" ] && [ "$DOC_MTIME" -lt "$(git log -1 --format=%ct)" ] && echo possibly-stale || echo unavailable
  fi
  ```

  The verdict is advisory-only; sha absent / no git → `unavailable`; no doc → "none found".

Then emit **exactly** this structure. Deterministic sections (`(verified)`) carry no per-line tags; inferred claims carry `[<✅|⚠️|❓> source: <file/cmd>]` (+ `verify:` below high confidence). Sections you cannot fill use the degraded-state language in [references/edge-cases.md](references/edge-cases.md) — never invented.

```markdown
## What `<project>` Is
<1–3 sentences: language, purpose, lineage.> [✅ source: ...]

## Architecture Highlights
<3–6 sourced bullets with glyphs.>

## Repo Layout (verified)
<code-fenced tree of directories actually present per find.>

## Current State
**Git:** <branch> · <clean | N uncommitted> · <sync vs origin> · latest `<sha>` <subject> · tags <top 5>.
**Working tree:** <top-N +X/-Y · +K untracked> (omit if clean).
**Last release:** <version + CHANGELOG gist; [Unreleased] count>.
**Beads ledger:** <total · closed · open · in-progress · blocked> (verified).
**mex:** <present | absent> · check <exit=N + first line, reported as-is — warnings at exit 0 are the stock baseline> · hot page: <one-line gist>.
**Continuity check:** <✓ | ⚠️ advisory | skipped | unavailable>.
**Last handoff:** <path> (<date>) — <headline>. Freshness: <✓ fresh | ⚠️ possibly stale — HEAD ahead of <DOC_SHA> | unavailable | none found>.<+N older unread if inbox_count>1>

| Bead | Pri | Title |
<up to 10 open ready beads by priority>

## Recent Activity
<3–5 commits as narrative · in-progress beads · prior thread from handoff. Degrades to "Fresh session — no prior in-session delta".>

**Hot page (verified):** <the lesson lines from the orient.sh `== mex ==` section — these are the operational rules that bind this repo>
**Relevant to ready work:** <route the top ready beads through `mex graph scope "<their titles>"`; then read the routed pages — routed hits are pointers, not knowledge — quoting only what bears on that work. Never echo credential-shaped content from a page body — the same rule as the handoff doc above>
**Remaining:** <pages routed but not read> — router: `.mex/ROUTER.md`; retrieval: `mex graph scope "<task>"`

---
<"Welcome back — last thread was <X>." ONLY when the freshness verdict is fresh; if possibly-stale: "Note: the newest handoff (<date>, <DOC_SHA>) predates HEAD — background context, not necessarily the last session.">
I'm ready for your next instruction. Highest-priority unblocked work: **<bead-id>** (<pri> — <title>).
If you want to start it, the fitting skill is **<skill>** — but I'll wait for your call; I won't claim or begin anything.
```

**Verification gate — run before emitting, fix or degrade, then re-check:**
1. Every Current State fact traces to a command run THIS session.
2. Every inferred claim carries glyph + source.
3. Unfillable sections use edge-cases degraded language — never invented.
4. Continuity + freshness checks ran (or are marked skipped/unavailable); the "Welcome back" line is suppressed unless fresh.
5. The checklist is fully ticked (or items marked skipped with reason).
6. **Summary-last** holds: step 4 is reported, and the terminal contract is the final line you write.

Done when: all six pass and the summary is emitted ending on the terminal contract.

## Terminal contract

The summary's closing lines are the contract: Do NOT auto-claim the next bead. Do NOT start work. Suggest the fitting *skill* and wait — the user drives.

## Red flags

| Pressure | Rule |
|---|---|
| "I remember this repo" | Sessions don't carry state — re-derive from ground truth. |
| "The summary looks complete" | Emit only through the verification gate. |
| "I'll claim the top bead to save time" | Terminal contract wins — `--claim` is forbidden here. |
| "The handoff says so" | Handoffs are narrative — cross-check against live state, tag ⚠️. |
| "Skimming is enough for a small repo" | Run the Light path; it still ends in a gated summary. |

## Edge cases

Anything off-path — no git, detached HEAD, empty log, hundreds of changed files, multi-doc inbox, archive failure, bd errors — has a prescribed behavior in [references/edge-cases.md](references/edge-cases.md); open it whenever a step returns something unexpected.

## Integration

**Uses:** `dispatching-parallel-agents` (Heavy path). **Pairs with:** `project-init` (fresh/empty repos).
