# Regression net for two confirmed defects:
#   vctf4.2 — Step 6 called `bd worktree info --path`, which is not a real flag.
#             2>/dev/null swallowed the error, WORKTREE_PATH was always empty,
#             and automatic worktree cleanup silently no-opped 100% of the time.
#   vctf4.3 — Option 1 deleted the branch while its worktree was still live
#             (git refuses) and never left the worktree before checking out base.
#
# The snippets under test are extracted from SKILL.md and executed, so the test
# fails if the shipped artifact regresses — not merely if prose is reworded.
